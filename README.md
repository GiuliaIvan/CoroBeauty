CoroBeauty is a website developed for my client and friend Andreea. She's a cosmetologist who has her own salon and multiple services to offer.

She needed online recognition to grow her business and have more clients - so I created a website that is appealing and informative, grabbing attention and giving intention - the intention to book appointments using the website.
